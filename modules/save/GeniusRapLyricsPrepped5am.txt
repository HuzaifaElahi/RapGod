incorporated inc into a flow
funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
laugh yo how'd that sound ooh




i could give a damn about a ill subliminal
stay away from crime so i ain't no criminal
i love my young nation groovy sensation
no time for hibernation only elation

yo mr busta rhymes tell him what i did

with speed i'm agile plus i'm worth your while
one hundred percent intelligent black child

how far must you go to gain respect umm
well it's kind of simple just remain your own

industry rule number fourthousandandeighty
record company people are shady
so kids watch your back 'cause i think they smoke crack
i don't doubt it look at how they act
well off to better things like a hiphop forum

and proper   what you say hammer proper
rap is not pop if you call it that then stop



sc y'all check it out y'all

check it out check it out





yo microphone check one two what is this

i float like gravity never had a cavity

no need to sweat arsenio to gain some type of fame

styles upon styles upon styles is what i have

i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
i never half step cause i'm not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name ain't special ed


even though deep in my heart it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out


zulu nation brothers last creation

yo when you bug out

sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding always surrounding
pulsing just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo he's acting stank really on a regal

believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much

once again a case of your feet in my nike's
if a crowd is in my realm i'm saying  mic please




yo i am not an invalid although

ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out


when i left for road see i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his maddest
it was one mc after one mc


or was it just because i used to


dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man
but now i wonder cause you're feeble

it's your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

mic check
when i was led to you



crowd around


i used to cop a lot but never copped no drop
hold mics like pony tails tied in bobbalobs


bound to go threeplat came to destroy rap
it's a intricate plot of a bboy strap
femstat cats get kidnapped

metal fist terrorists claim responsibility
broken household name usually said in hostility
um what is mf you silly

doodoodoodoodoo that's a audio daily double






right above my government dumile
either unmarked or engraved hey who's to say


i wrote this one in bc dc osection


i say this not to be mean wish bad luck or pop junk

god forbid if there ain't no escape blame mf tape

one who is wellskilled in destruction as well as building




get out my face askin'    bout my case need toothpaste


real mens mind their own business


co's make rounds never have    ox found
on shakedown lockdown wet dreams of fox' brown


on doomsday

that's what my tomb will say
right above my government dumile
either unmarked or engraved hey who's to say


doomsday


either engraved or unmarked grave who's to say



some mer fers don't like how sally walk
i'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from cali talk



known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans


clang crime don't pay listen youth



but then she has a sexy voice sound like jazzy joyce
so i turned it up faster than a speeding knife
strong enough to please a wife







when i was led to you








so nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty

keep your battery charged you know it won't

should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow

and you know i know that's a bunch of snow


sometimes he rhyme quick sometimes he rhyme slow
or vice versa whip up a slice of nice verse pie

spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses


and show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses


it's ugly like look at you it's a damn shame



and you know it like a poet like baby doll
i bet she tried to say she gave me her all she played ball




the pot doubles now they really got troubles
madman never go pop like snot bubbles







the best emcee with no chain ya ever heard

they've bit but don't know their neck shine from shinola
everything that glitters ain't fishscale
lemme think don't let her faint get ishmael
a shot of jack got her back it's not an act stack

villainy feel him in ya heart chakra chart toppa
start shit stoppa be a smart shoppa


'bout to jet get him not a bet dead 'em






the flow make her fatty shake patty cake patty cake
for fake if he was anita baker's man
he'd take her for her masters hit it once an' shake her hand
on some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her

a whole host of roller coaster riders
not enough tracks is it
hot enough black for ya
it's too hot to handle you got blue sandals
who shot ya ooh got you new spots to vandal
do not stand still boast yo' skills
close but no krills toast for po' nils post no bills
coast to coast joe shmoe's flows ill go chill
not supposed to overdose nodoz pills
off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
off sides like how worf rides with starfleet
told ya on some getrich shit
as he get older he gets colder than a witch tit
this is it make no mistakes

figaro figaro



a scary act
all black like ms mary mack

doom sings soprano like una duociano
my momma told me

not to be troublesome
but i could sure use a quick shot of double rum
no stick of bubble gum
i like ice cream

have a nice dream






























beat switch








beef rap could lead to getting teeth capped
or even a wreath for ma dukes on some grief crap
i suggest you change your diet
it can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
or even a stroke heart attack heart disease
it ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze


so disgusting pardon self as i discuss this



he be better off on pc glued
and it's a feud so don't be in no tv mood
every week it's mystery meat seaweed stewed
food we need food



a rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous

they need it like a hole in they head or a third tit





stop feeding babies colored sugarcoated lard squares


i wrote this note around new year's




whether is it animal vegetable or mineral
it's a miracle how he get so lyrical

for a mil' do a commercial for mello yello
tell 'em devil's hell no sell y'all own jello
we hollow krills she swallow pills
he follow flea collar three dollar bills
and squeal for halal veal if y'all appeal

twirl a l after every meal food


what up

and keep your shirt on at least a buttonup
yuck is they rhymers or strippin' males
out of work jerks since they shut down chippendales
they chippin' nails doom tippin' scales

this one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail




overproof drunk shit but who'd'a thunk it









sleeping in a jar
sleeping in a jar

sleeping in a jar




heat niner pimping stripping soft sweet minor

digits double dipped bubble lipped subtle lisp midget
borderline schizo sort of fine tits though

ever since ten eleven glad she made a brethren

knocking no answer slow dancer hopeless romancer dopest flow stanzas
yes no villain metal face to destro
guess so still incredible in escrow

wild west style fest y'all best to lay low


the worst hated god who perpetrated odd favors

in all quad flavors lord save us


on a fast track to half insane

laughter pain


he's at it again

glad that we win a tad fat in a bad hat for men


the van screeches
the old man preaches

the cold hand reaches

 jesus

i told her i'd come scoop her around  she said super
that sounds great shorty girl's a trooper
no matter what i need her to do she be like super


average emcees is like a tv blooper
mf doom he's like db cooper


i wonder if she meant it i doubt it
the way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
and can't live with this handle your business
villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
one pack of cookies please mr hooper

look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
weirdo brown skin'ded always kept his hair low
rumor has it it's a scurl accident


a lot of guys wonder where they stacks went

only mess with high rollers do what daddy told her




keep my eye on her really don't trust her
but i treat her like a daughter taught her how to bust a nut


see most cats treat her like foofur

you need to make her feel cuter

do for her keep her in a new fur



listen here scooter let her try to bag you

which'll have you under some type of spell crying dag boo
her name on your back in a tattoo
whether a bourgie broad nerd ho street chick

you don't want her don't waste her time i'll dupe her


sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
tell 'em take his clothes leave him posing naked for real


make sure for extra wreck let him know how you feel
and while he's running down to all star weekend to ball

 super
 super

























great stuff
yeah this is    this is good
great stuff
ahh oh yeah
applause




or a foe for ransom flows is handsome
o's in tandem anthem random tantrum

masked pump shotty somebody stop me
hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
after rockin' parties he departed in a jalopy


blimey simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
madvillain dashing in a beatrhyme crime spree

got more soul than a sock with a hole


overthrow 'em like throwing rover a biscuit
a lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic

rats what a waste there's more cats to chase   
dogs he got it like new powers


had your fam saying please make me a dub
well since you ask kindly



cowboy


applause
no no no no enough


goony goo goo loony cuckoo
like gary gnu off new zoo revue but who knew
the mask had a loose screw hell could hardly tell




at least a track list in bold print typeface
stopped for a year
come back with thumb tacks pop full of beer
we're hip hop sharecroppers
used to wear flip flops now rare gear coppers

you might as well not ask him for no free shit capiche
oh my aching hands

villain   his smile stuns ya chick
while he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks

play it in your stereo your crew'll go apeshit
raw lyrics   he smells 'em like a hunch




he said you bet your sweet ass
it's made of fine chrome alloy



applause


sometimes they were comedic    or relentlessly horrifying



the villains

applause




i get no kick from champagne
mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
so tell me why shouldn't it be true
i get a kick out of brew


there's only one beer left
rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf


like it's on me   put it on my tab kid
however you get there foot it cab it iron horse it
you're leaving on your face forfeit

told him tell her they stole it  he told her he lost it

getting money dt's be getting no new leads
it's like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds

soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough
they group been soft


she asked him autograph her derriere read
   to wide load this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
love villain    take pride in code words
crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart

no he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer's eye
and squeeze her thigh maybe give her curves a feel
the same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel

how there only one left the pack comes in six


like what you doing g
don't make me have to get cutting like truancy

looser than a pair of adidas
i hope you brought your spare tweeters
mc's sound like cheerleaders

doom came do his thing again no matter who be blingin'

seeds know what time it is like it's time for tellie tubbies
few can do it even fewer can sell it

he plots shows like robberies



bring heat like your boy done gone to war

a whole string of jobs like we on tour



there it is done


and when they meet tomorrow in special session

my plan is foolproof but just in case


and what about snow

admiring my style tour bus through manhattan

they better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
during tornado time with no coat than i caught ya

with no headshot he said it's been a while
got a breadwinner style to get a inner child up in a smile
and that's no exaggeration
the doctor told a patient it's all in your imagination negro
ahh what do he know


since new york plates was ghetto yellow
with broke blue writing this is too exciting

they say the villain been spitting enough lightning



yeah check it's enough

how med hold heat like clint east is reborn
leave you with more holes than a dartboard
haters watch him hennessy double shot drink





thanks to rap i ain't got a dime




street turns keep me in this dirt like an earthworm

worth a word chat with a nerd meeting adjourned
