sometimes i'mma wanna make a movie
and when it come to rapping fast i'm the higgs boson

i could still break your body down to five pieces like i did voltron
'cause i'm addicted to the craft and i be off a og
know me i'm the obi-wan kenobi of the dope see
never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
cooler like i'm offa codeine low key
don't be so judgmental even though i'm reminiscing
if i don't know what i miss is
i'ma end up figuring out that it's home
and my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
this is just a testament to the ones that raised me
the ones that i praise and i'm thanking
i need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
and i wanna get a hug and i can't 'cause i'm stanking
never too old for a spanking igh

kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
the richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
spineless bitches in backless dresses
wore my feelings on my sleeveless
my weed seedless my trees leafless
i miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
and back when mike jackson was still jesus
before i believed in not believing in
yeah i inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
my big homie died young just turned older than him
i seen it happen i seen it happen i see it always
he still be screaming i see his demons in empty hallways
i trip to make the fall shorter
fall quarter was just a tall order
and i'm hungry i'm just not that thirsty
as of late all my verses seem not so verse-y
and all my words just mean controversy
took the team up off my back like that's not your jersey
stressin' pullin' my hair out hoping i don't get picked
all this medicine in me hoping i don't get sick
making all of this money hoping i don't get rich
'cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
sometimes the truth don't rhyme
sometime the lies get millions of views
funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
from your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
i think love is beautiful too
building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
for future hoopers dead from rugers
shooting through the empty alley
could've threw him an alley-oop
helping him do good in school
damn that acid burn when it clean ya
i still miss being a senior
and performing at all those open mic events
eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
and i still get jealous of vic
and vic's still jealous of me
but if you touch my brother
all that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
and the rest of your team
smoking cigarettes to look cooler
i only stop by to look through ya
and i'm only getting greedier
and i'm still mr. youmedia
and i still can't find talent
and i'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
mom still thinks i should go back to school
and justin still thinks i'm good enough
and mama jan still don't take her meds
and i still be asking god to show his face
and i still be asking god to show his face

outro
i am a new man i am sanctified
oh i am holy i have been baptized
i have been born again i am the white light
rain rain don't go away

we used to roll at the rink we used to roll at the rink
i used to talk way too much you used to know everything
you couldn't stand me i couldn't stand you
you said i'm steady playin' but you steady playin' too
your big brother foot work
your play sister juke
the rink was the place
but in that space and time i was too young for you
as you were for me too worried 'bout frooties and chews
'til i found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
and realized what booties could do

yo shout out to everybody that worked on the album you feel me son
yo shouts out to ty dollas
shouts out to hodgy daddies shouts out to left brizzle
shouts out to domyen shouts out to frankie ocean
shouts out to syd the dude shouts out to l-boy awwwwk

verse  tyler the creator
the big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
in a bag and wrappin' them in saran wrap bandages
tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
so when he says catch up nigga it looks like an accident
um flowing like my pad is the maxiest
my bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
it's the dark skinned nigga kissing bitches in canada
then kicking all out like mr. lawrence did pamela
put her in the chamber all against her wilt chamberlain
i never had a reason nigga i was just ableton
not a fucking logic contradicting dick head
flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
semen-scented cheetah printed tee
in that 'preme five panel i'll repeat it for the season
previous items in the present
with the normal-ass past like i cheated on my team
it's me tried to get that nigga but golf wang
see he did come back though

verse  hodgy beats
to have some type of knowledge that is one perception
but knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
i'm zeus to a kronos cartilage cartridge is boneless
smiles of cowards in lead showers dead spouses in red blouses
children who fled houses on mustang horses and went joustin'
i'm on my robin hood shit robbing in the hood
whips drugs jewels and your pet i'm stealin' your rims
coke diamonds and your vette soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
and salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
it's killhodgy nigga stay the fuck off my stoop
and out my kool-aid juice

verse  left brain
whats up bitch
hodgy got the juice i got the gin
jasper got the henny my nigga we get it in
wolf gang party at the hotel

you know left brain need a freak
i need a bitch to go down like a nitty beat
yup uh and her ass fat
don't be surprised if i ask where the hash at
nigga i'm tryna smoke bitch get higher
domo where that flocka flame talking 'bout a lighter
still bang salute me or just shoot me
'cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
yeah my nigga ace will pull the black jack
the king mike g is in the cut with the black mac
we like the mafia bitch don't get to slacking up
and if these haters acting up throw 'em in the aqueduct
free my nigga earl yo i don't really ask for much
but two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

verse  mike g
what the fuck is caution
often i leave 'em flossing in kaws exes next to coffins
lost in translation the dreams you chase
got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
that's great i'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
with rihanna and christina milian bring it on
and travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
three lettermans that ace has been making him
no strays while we catching matinees huh
i'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
i had the top off the gt like toupees
one finger in the air all's fair when crime pays
my grand scheme of things is to be attached
to the game like bitches to their wedding rings
and you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
in the light ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
like the batman logo over gotham rock la to harlem
if you say get 'em mike g then i got 'em
one man squadron nigga i'm a problem
from briggs i got bars and plans to
pimp these polish bitches into pop stars
humanity kills we all suffer from insanity still
and if i said it then it is or it's gonna be real
of 'til i od and i probably will uh

verse  domo genesis
it's still mr. smoke-a-lotta-pot get your baby mommy popped
with my other snobby bop do i love her probably not
know your shit is not as hot as anything i fuckin' drop
bitch i'm in the zone stand alone like macaulay cock
i've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
big wheel was a big deal with the water glocks
now i'm all grown same song just a different waltz
fire what i talk but still cooler than an otter pop
op dom next shit in your wish list
mad sick shit mad dick for your bitches
on some slick shit your mistress on my hit list
and i'm lifted 'til i'm stiff outta this bitch
odd in your motherfuckin' area
blood clots give me five feet 'fore i bury ya
suicide flow let the big wave carry ya
tyler got the mask like he held jim carrey up

on the song cut and you could sample the feel
headphone bleed make this shit sound real
used to work the grill fatburger and fries
then i made a mil' and them psychics was liars

humble old me had to flex for the folks
down in muscle beach pumping iron and bone
bumping oldies off my cellular phone

interlude jasper dolphin

verse  earl sweatshirt
look for contrast here's a pair of lips
swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
whoops whoops fuckin' all-american terrorist
crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
and me i just spent a year ferrisin'
and lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel so that sterile piss
flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
narrow tight line might impair him since
i made it back to fahrenheit grimey get dinero type
feral fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
la di da di back in here to fuck the party up
raidin' fridges tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
never dollars poppa make it rain hockey pucks
and sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
off the wall loafers four loko and a cobra clutch
vocals bold and rough evoke a ho to pose as drum
and let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
the culprit of the potent punch
scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a folgers cup
or nevada drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
and shittin' like his colon bust
belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
supernova i'm rollin' over the novices
and roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
to escort it to the morgue again lord of lips
bored of this forklift the tippy top best under  list
stormin' the gate ensurin' the bass
scorchin' leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
get at me we savages half a pack of apache
indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
as a matter of fact your swagger is tacky
so see me you can't like crunchy black catchin' a taxi
uh back like lateral passin'
with that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
as an addict i let percocet and xannies relax me
fall back if your paddies is maxi please

verse  tyler the creator
of shit that's all i got
from my bigger brother frankie to my little brother tac
from that father figure clancy to that skatey nigga nak
shreddin' down 'fax wolf gang run the fuckin' block
storefront knee tat
book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
and grip tape... and my shoes
um i was fifteen when i first drew that donut
five years later for our label yeah we own it
i started an empire i ain't even old enough
to drink a fucking beer i'm tipsy off this soda pop
this is for the niggas in the suburbs
and the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
and the ones that got called weird fag bitch nerd
'cause you was into jazz kitty cats and steven spielberg

always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white

fuck who you know where you from my nigga
where your grandma stay huh my nigga
this m.a.a.d city i run my nigga

verse  kendrick lamar
brace yourself i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me l boog and yan yan yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly wavin' yo' hand out the window     check yourself
uh warriors and conans hope euphoria can slow dance
with society the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door fuck is up
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up you fuckin' punk
pickin' up the fuckin' pump pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's ar's aye y'all   duck
that's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in ' fuck yo' truce
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty just piecin' bgs up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes except
when we in traffic and tragic happens that shit ain't no threat
you movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial i guess

let me teach you some lessons about the street
smoke somethin' nigga
hood 'sup cuz
it ain't nothin' but a compton thang
g-yeah how we do

verse  kendrick lamar
fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad'
sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
reality struck i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact i got fired 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin' the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a.k.a. compton's human sacrifice

interlude mc eiht
g-yeah cocaine weed
niggas been mixin' shit since the 's loc
sherm sticks butt-nakeds
dip make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra rosecrans bullis it's compton

verse  mc eiht
i'm still in the hood loc yeah that's cool
shit the hood took me under so i follow the rules
but yeah that's like me i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-by's in the hood lately shit
couple of iv's with the fuckin' spray-can
shots in the crowd then everybody ran
crew i'm finna slay the street life i crave
shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
mount up regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah
trip we in the hood still
so loc grab a strap 'cause yeah it's so real yeah
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

verse  kendrick lamar
if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
or see me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat
if i mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
probably go to the projects i
live inside the belly of the rough compton usa
made me an angel on angel dust what

only lord knows i've been goin' hammer
dodgin' paparazzi freakin' through the cameras
eat at four daughters brock wearin' sandals
yoga on a monday stretchin' to nirvana
watchin' all the snakes curvin' all the fakes

look up in the sky  is on the way
sentence on the way killings on the way
motherfucker i got winners on the way
you ain't shit without a body on your belt
you ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
you ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
you ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
peace to the world let it rotate

how can i paint this picture
when the color blind is hangin' with you
fell on my face and awoke with a scar
another mistake livin' deep in my heart

compulsive disorder sons and daughters
barricaded blocks and borders
look what you taught us
it's murder on my street your street back streets
wall street corporate offices
banks employees and bosses with
homicidal thoughts donald trump's in office
we lost barack and promised to never doubt him again
but is america honest or do we bask in sin
pass the gin i mix it with american blood
then bash him in you crippin' or you married to blood
i'll ask again     oops accident
it's nasty when you set us up
then roll the dice then bet us up
you overnight the big rifles then tell fox to be scared of us
gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
america's reflections of me that's what a mirror does

chorus bono
it's not a place
this country is to me a sound
of drum and bass

i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
you're in the mood for empathy there's blood in my pen
better yet where your friends and 'em
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends
and y'all curled in that little bitty range
i heard that she wanna go and party she wanna go and party

young east african girl you too busy fuckin' with your other man
i was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
take you and your momma to the motherland
i could do it maybe one day
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's alright here in the city
and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice poetic justice
you were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin
and your big ass in that sundress ooh
good god what you doin' that walk for
when i see that thing move
i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
they say communication save relations i can tell

livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talkin' poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
would you trust it i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb it's you lookin' in the mirror
love is not just a verb it's you lookin' for it maybe
call me crazy we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
i mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
and i can see power steerin' sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference it's coherent i can hear it
uh-huh that's your heartbeat

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

verse 
i never knew a luh luh-luh a love like this
gotta be somethin' for me to write this
queen i ain't seen you in a minute
wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
love has no limit let's spend it slow forever
i know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
i ain't gon' assault them    cause i probably did it too
because of you feelings i handle with care
some niggas recognize the light
but they can't handle the glare
you know i ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
if relationship is effort i will match your work
i want to be the one to make you happiest
and hurt you the most
they say the end is near it's important that we close
to the most high
regardless of what happen on him let's rely

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

verse 
it's important we communicate
and tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
i never call you my bitch or even my boo
there's so much in a name and so much more in you
few understand the union of woman and man
and sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
but that's fly by night for you and the sky i write
for in these cold chi night's moon you my light
if heaven had a height you would be that tall
ghetto to coffee shop through you i see that all
let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
for better or worse times i hope to me you call
so i pray every day more than anything
friends will stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family love ain't simple
why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually
granted we known each other for some time
it don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

verse 
it's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and i can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
plus you shit pop when it's time to
thinkin' you fresh suggestin' beats i should rhyme to
at times when i'm lost i try to find you
you know to give me space when it's time to
my heart's dictionary defines you it's love and happiness
truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
the time we committed love it was real good
had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
i know the sex ain't gon' keep you
but as my equal it's how i must treat you
as my reflection in light i'ma lead you
and whatever's right i'ma feed you
digga-da digga-da digga-da digga-digga-da-da
yo i tell you the rest when i see you peace

verse 
i met this girl when i was  years old
and what i loved most she had so much soul
she was old school when i was just a shorty
never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
on the regular not a church girl she was secular
not about the money those studs was mic-checkin' her
but i respected her she hit me in the heart
a few new york niggas had did her in the park
but she was there for me and i was there for her
pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
and just cool out cool out and listen to her
sittin' on a bone wishin' that i could do her
eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
   cause we related physically and mentally
and she was fun then i'd be geeked when she'd come around
slim was fresh joe when she was underground
original pure untampered a down sister
boy i tell you i miss her

verse 
now periodically i would see
ol' girl at the clubs and at the house parties
she didn't have a body but she started gettin' thick quick
did a couple of videos and became afrocentric
out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
she was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
about my people she was teachin' me
by not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
in a method that was leisurely so easily i approach
she dug my rap that's how we got close
but then she broke to the west coast and that was cool
cause around the same time i went away to school
and i'm a man of expandin' so why should i stand in her way
she probably get her money in l.a.
and she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
she said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
she said afrocentricity was of the past
so she got into r&b hip-house bass and jazz
now black music is black music and it's all good
i wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
cause that was good for her she was becomin' well-rounded
i thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
just havin' fun not worried about anyone
and you could tell by how her titties hung

chorus
a-yes yes y'all and you don't stop

and to the beat com gotta be the sure shot
a-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
if you don't check it mm-mm bust it bust it

verse 
i might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
once the man got to her he altered her native
told her if she got an image and a gimmick
that she could make money and she did it like a dummy
now i see her in commercials she's universal
she used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
now she be in the burbs lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
and on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
talkin' bout poppin' glocks servin' rocks and hittin' switches
now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
tellin' me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
stressin' how hardcore and real she is
she was really the realest before she got into showbiz
i did her not just to say that i did it
but i'm committed girl he's committed but so many niggas hit it
that she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
i see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
but i'ma take her back hopin' that the shit stop
   cause who i'm talkin' about y'all is hip-hop

chorus

verse  common
hands to the heavens no man no weapon
formed against yes glory is destined
every day women and men become legends
sins that go against our skin become blessings
the movement is a rhythm to us
freedom is like religion to us
justice is juxtapositionin' us
justice for all just ain't specific enough
one son died his spirit is revisitin' us
true and livin' livin' in us resistance is us
that's why rosa sat on the bus
that's why we walk through ferguson with our hands up
when it go down we woman and man up
they say stay down and we stand up
shots we on the ground the camera panned up
king pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

verse  common
selma is now for every man woman and child
even jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
they marched with the torch we gon' run with it now
never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
from dark roads he rose to become a hero
facin' the league of justice his power was the people
enemy is lethal a king became regal
saw the face of jim crow under a bald eagle
the biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
we sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
now we right the wrongs in history
no one can win the war individually
it takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
welcome to the story we call victory
the comin' of the lord my eyes have seen the glory

chorus
one day when the glory comes
it will be ours it will be ours
one day when the war is won

how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
it's a place i got to be
loving you is loving me
how beautiful love can be
on the streets love is hard to see
gotta reach that frequency
loving you is loving me

verse 
yeah you know what love is
even found it on the ground where the thugs live
my man had to dig deep to find his
couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
live nig's real niggas express and taste it
at crap games black dames and big faces
cases in court fam' showing love and support
you and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
as men we were taught to hold it in
that's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
if love is a place i'ma go again
at least now now i know to go within
at times it can take ya for a spin
heartbreak hotel then you're home again
i've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
like a story that he don't want to end
yo

hook

verse 
it's all love where we come from
in the hood love we was told to run from
that same hood where the guns sung
we holla love hoping it'd become one
crack got so many lives undone
from lack of love many hide some run
i knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
trying to find herself again much of that she'd have gave
love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
funny we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
wonder if a thug is raw is he actin' afraid
everybody loves sun why do i attract shade
heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
what it is to be loved by a man

hook

verse 
some say that i'm a dreamer cause i talk about it often
seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
we walk and stand in fall in it

in the game of life it's the scrimmage
reminiscing on letters i wrote in my small days

look i apologize often womanize
took for my child to be born see through a woman's eyes
took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
took me too long for this song i don't deserve you
i harassed you out in paris
please come back to rome you make it home
we talked for hours when you were on tour
   please pick up the phone pick up the phone   
i said    don't embarrass me    instead of    be mine   
that was my proposal for us to go steady
that was your st birthday
you matured faster than me i wasn't ready
so i apologize
i seen the innocence leave your eyes
i still mourn this death and
i apologize for all the stillborns cause i wasn't present
your body wouldn't accept it
i apologize to all the women whom i toyed with your emotions
'cause i was emotionless
and i apologize 'cause at your best you are love
and because i fall short of what i say i'm all about
your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
and you stare blankly into space
thinkin' of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
so i apologize

i'm never gonna treat you
i'm never gonna treat you like i should

i apologize our love was one for the ages and i contained us
and all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
or sleep with our back turned
we supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
we're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
and then meet in a space where the dark stop
and let love light the way
like the men before me i cut off my nose to spite my face
i never wanted another woman to know
something about me that you didn't know
i promised i cried i couldn't hold
i suck at love i think i need a do-over
i will be emotionally available if i invited you over
i stew over what if you over my shit

you did what with who
what good is a m  nage    trois when you have a soulmate
you risked that for blue

intro
yeah gotta say what's up to my nigga slick rick
for those who don't like it eat a dick
but for those who with me sing that shit
as it go a little something like this

verse 
lodi dodi we likes to party
we don't cause trouble we don't bother nobody
we're just some niggas who're on the mic
and when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right
for all my doggs keepin' y'all in health
just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
cause it's cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
which we create cause that's our mission
so listen close to what we say
because this types of shit happens every day

i woke up around  o'clock in the morning
i gave myself a strech up a morning yawn and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said um mirror mirror on the wall
who is the top dog of them all
there was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
the mirror said you are you conceited bastard
well that's true that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put some bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean dry was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh dressed like a million bucks
threw on my white socks with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house stopped short oh no
i went back in i forgot my indo
then i dilly dally i ran through an alley
i bumped into this smoker named sally from the valley
this was a girl playing hard-to-get
so i said what's wrong cause she looked upset
she said um

nancy flethcer
it's all because of you i'm feeling sad and blue
you went away now my life is filled with rainy days
i love you so how much you'll never know
cause you took your dope away from me

verse 
damn now what was i to do
she's crying over me and she was feelin blue
i said um don't cry dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys
her mean mother steps then says to me hi
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong the kids was gone
something was wrong i said what was goin on
i tried to break it up i said stop it just leave her
she said if i can't smoke none she can't either
she grabbed me closely by my socks
so i broke the hell out and i grabbed my sack of rocks
but um they gave chase they caught up quick
they started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
and saying

why don't you give me a play
so we can break it down the long beach way
and if you give me that okay
i'll give you all my love today
doggy doggy doggy can't you see
somehow your words just hypnotize me
and i just love your jazzy ways
doggy dogg your love is here to stay

and on and on and on she kept going
the bitch been around before my mother born
i said cheer up and i gave her a hit
i said you can't have me i'm too young for you bitch
she said no you're not then she starts cryin
i says i'm  she says stop lyin
i says i am go ask my mother
and with your wrinkled pussy i can't be your lover

i used to care what people thought but now i care more
i mean nobody out here's got it figured out
so therefore i've lost all hope of a happy ending
depending on whether or not it's worth it so insecure no one's perfect
we spend it with no shame we blow that like coltrane
we in here like rogaine or leave it like cobain
and when i'm long gone whole crew sing a swan song
cause we all just ticking time bombs got a lambo like lebron's mom
and no matter where all of my friends go emily fam and lorenzo
all of them people my kinfolk at least i think so can't tell
cause when them checks clear they're not here
cause they don't care it's kinda sad but i'm laughing whatever happens
assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
labrador yapping i'm glad that it happened i mean it
between us i think there's something special and if i lose my mental
just hold my hand even if you don't understand hold up

verse  big sean

but i still take my time man i guess i'm just old fashioned
wearing retro shit that's old fashion
nigga see what i'm saying no closed caption

keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
i plead the fifth drink a fifth load the nine
leave you split in the half smoke a half need a zip
my new girl is on glee and shit
probably making more money than me and shit
i swear to god i got  problems but a bitch ain't one
i got  problems getting rich ain't one
like i got trust issues
i'm sorry for the people i've pushed out
i'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
and still gotta pull out
but that's just me and i ain't perfect
i ain't a saint but i am worth it
if it's one thing i am worth it
niggas still hating but it ain't working

the other night
lavish lee told me that i'm all these people listen to
she said they love me unconditional
imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
you know that if you wasn't you you would be dissin' you dawg
damn okay from that perspective
i see what you're talkin' 'bout no way to soften that
'cause me i was tryna find out where i lost 'em at
but maybe i ain't lose 'em at all
maybe i keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
they ain't movin' at all
but when they need a favor who do they call
maybe i'm searchin' for the problems
askin' what was said and who was involved
too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot it's on
these days feel like i'm squeezin' in 'em
whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
i'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'cause if i run in the game in these man the seams are splittin'
no pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
headed where nobody took it who meetin' me there
they tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
listen up boy you're better off eavesdroppin'
we already got spring  poppin'
pnd droppin' reps-up p droppin'
majid jordan droppin' ob droppin' not to mention me droppin'
feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
me and noel been at it before twitter names
yeah been on the move like the lease is up
and i can't even name one person that's keepin' up
damn fuck how it was in the past tense
ask yourself how do we match up now
'cause i'm only  and i'm only gettin' better
if i haven't passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

she gon' take the brain to wetter plains she spit on that

dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division

verse  q-tip
zulu nation brothers last creation
minds get flooded ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
to get my point across so bust the floss
as i go in between the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work umm
as i crack the monotone
children of the jazz so get your own
smokin r&b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they can't do rap

yo when you bug out
you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding always surrounding
pulsing just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo he's acting stank really on a regal
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nike's
if a crowd is in my realm i'm saying -- mic please
hip-hop is living can't yank the plug
if you do the result will end up kind of bugged

verse  q-tip
yo i am not an invalid although
i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
when i left for road see i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his maddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world
or was it just because i used to
swipe the women and all the girls
i'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man
but now i wonder cause you're feeble
i go out with the strongies and i separate the evils
it's your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

verse  q-tip
can i kick it to all the people who can quest like a tribe does
before this did you really know what live was
comprehend to the track for it's why cuz
gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
if you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
afrocentric living is a big shrug
a life filled with fun that's what i love
a lower plateau is what we're above
if you diss us we won't even think of
will nipper the doggy give a big shove
this rhythm really fits like a snug glove
like a box of positives it's a plus love
as the tribe flies high like a dove
can i kick it

can i kick it to my tribe that flows in layers
right now phife is a poem sayer
at times i'm a studio conveyor
mr. dinkins would you please be my mayor
you'll be doing us a really big favor
boy this track really has a lot of flavor
when it comes to rhythms quest is your savior
follow us for the funky behavior
make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
feel free drop your pants check your ha-ir
do you like the garments that we wear
i instruct you to be the obeyer
a rhythm recipe that you'll savor
doesn't matter if you're minor or major

as you inhale like a breath of fresh air
can i kick it

you dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
he touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
she frequents the fattest joints caught underground
our funk zooms like you hit the mary jane
they flock to booms man boogie had to change
who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
when butterfly rocked his light blue-suede pumas
what by the cut we push it off the corner
how was the buzz entire hip hop era
was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie

you want some beef they will cut you some where i'm from
the beats is infinite where i'm from
voodoo ashubani gangsta lean where i'm from
i'm interplanetary my insect movements vary
it's kinky if it's hair g where i'm from
the fire hoses blow
it's purple when it snow
i do a hit and go split
it's hip what's hip
when hip is just the norm
cause planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
the kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
my grandmother told my mama that it's africa at work
on vibes we freak them universal beats
you find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
we twist exist to spin the maddest hits
up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
the lip we sip can't house the nine zips
for rock we can't do nothing for this we come equipped
off disc off tape rap blasting til from eight

but planets is the joint this year right yeah
planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hip-hop
rising like we foam get it from the dome
i'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
we can get a kit without no thread
feeling funky beats go straight to the head
fall into a club dig on what we love
it be past six before we reach bed
butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
doodle mecc and silk the quad where it's at
we need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
so we treat our clips just like busting caps
rip it till dawn kick it till dawn

diving deep into the grooves of the ghetto

dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
lyrical skills of the insect in motion
coasting down fulton with a bag of magic potion

butterfly searching for a relax
pulling from the jazz stacks cause it's sunday
on the air is incense sounds to the ceiling
tried to get this feeling since monday
looking out the window watching all the people go
bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems they're equal
wonder what would trane say wonder what my pop say
bugging off the calmness in the apple
who me i'm cooling in new york
i'm chilling in new york
the hoods is on my block and the brother's at the court
the baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
dreamtime's extended and highly recommended
but early birds like me's up checking out the scene
the early worms jog forget about your job
just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
when people act like people the theory is in pigeon
if you know the norm it's like hades transformed
on sunday's early hours the city sprouts its flowers
so get with the rhythms while you getting with the planets
vibe off the jams but don't take em for granted just chill

we venture through the streets in search of funky beats
extensive is the travels and it's heavy on the sneaks
ye it's kicking out the speakers of the sunday morning jeepers
my man do planets do it lovely
am i my brother's keeper
we foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
and sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
hanging with the rebels sipping on a snapple
bugging with my crew just tripping in the apple
you be thinking peace when you're vibing with your flock
but you be thinking damn everybody got a glock
if you got some beef please express that in silence
or else violence
but right here is the life it's the children of the concrete
living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
hip-hop's all around the members is growing
please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing so chill

wake up praying that the game's on
maybe it's the running rebs maybe it's the knicks
maybe it's a rerun of an old tv show
like hawaii - or karate flicks
maybe if the phone rings butterfly will take wings
speaking on some cool things fronting like i cope
born unto flat ground now i'm chilling shaky ground
reaching for pacific heights sunday is my rope dig it
sunday's to relax
sunday's to relax
some sunday morning drama is calling up my mama
the hot line is in i guess the silvers knew the deal
vibing off the jams of the crews on sugarhill
lay around and think ain't nothing to do
checking out some fromm some sartre camus
mingus' ah um damn roach can drum
the dp's are life there they go here they come
it's time to grab some loot put on the timber boots
checking out some dali's like tasha and kamali

butterfly
it was  on a beautiful th day of july
there was not a cloud to speak of so the orange sun hung
lonely in the sky
i lay prone in my catbeat home
listening to fine nappy jackie and his jazzcat's horn
sliding in a tape of bird on verve when suddenly rang my phone
hey butterfly the voice said
slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
the vibe here is very pleasant and i truly request your presence
a problem of great magnitude has arose
and as we speak it grows
damn what could it be i thought
a juice i bought and rolled on down to her spot
seeing bros i know slapping fives i arrived and pressed g-
and there was nikki
lookin' some kind of sad with tears fallin' from her eyes
she sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down
you remember my boyfriend sid that fly kid who i love
well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
but due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate
about this we don't feel great but baby that's how it is
but the feds have dissed me
they ignored and dismissed me
the pro-lifers harass me outside the clinic
and call me a murderer now that's hate
so needless to say we're in a mental state of debate
hey beautiful bird i said digging her somber mood
the fascists are some heavy dudes
they don't really give a damn about life
they just don't want a woman to control her body
or have the right to choose
but baby that ain't nothin'
they just want a male finger on the button
because if you say war they will send them to die by the score
aborting mission should be your volition
but if souter and thomas have their way
you'll be standing in line unable to get welfare while they'll be out
hunting and fishing
it has always been around it will always have a niche
but they'll make it a privilege not a right
accessible only to the rich
hey pro-lifers need to dig themselves
because life doesn't stop after birth
and for a child born to the unprepared
it might even just get worse
the situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it
supporters of the h-bomb and fire-bombing clinics
what type of shit is that orwellian in fact
if roe v. wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
leaving young girls to risk their healths
and doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
i don't want to sound macabre
but hey isn't it my job
to lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
to fight against these fascists
so whatever you decide make that move with pride
sid will be there and so will i
an insect 'til i die

rhythms and sounds
spinning around
confrontations
across the nation
your block
my block
dreadlocks
what a shock
land of the free
but not me not me

verse  ladybug mecca
so now lets let into in my pocket pack
pummel and i epic black ethic lack
i walk again you were shade gray come display
mazes in black fire in the west
shit is shakin' it's fly
i'm in lookies when i'm pushing vinyl time
up the fort where i'm caught
and my thought to shakin' up a few loose
now i let my cause shoot krs one
cause we fade in and out are you swinging or coming
i'm solid on this thought this ain't living
it's heavy every setback even when i was a shorty
now we catch you in your four thrice
check me in another place space and joy
nothing you could serve could ever
ace me boy
fat laces i'm out fat and no babies

verse  doodlebug
i got harlem on my mind darren on my back
brooklyn in my blood and butter's on the track
i got insect thoughts catch the cool ways
clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
the jazz the jive the poetry
the style the lingo the bags of equality
many different things try to get to me
but in a world of hard rock i keep my humility
the funkanaut from the kingdom of not
with galactic sure shot they can't won't don't stop
flock to the rhythm i bring
sing songs call survival on the mingus revival
scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
it's doodlebug give me love for a visual script
sip the groove juice it's kind of rough
sevens never bluff i had enough eleven

chorus
that's right sho you right
that's right sho you right
that's right sho you right

verse  butterfly
in the east i rose
froze in the pose
of a land diseased
flows that cooler summer breeze
nikki did kevin's braids we got four in the 'lac
as we swoop at warp seven holler don't crowd cats
cause look corpie is the color and butter he do it low
all you hear is poppers and rubber i'm saying oh
man we keep it popping on hot days
shit i got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
and i dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
i'm fro blow got that right
groove with soul and i'm still spinnin'
cross  and indicate them something else
blackest space deepest sea
scoff my shit's a natural high the man can't put no thing on me
now catch me when my mind stretch out it's astro black
time reaching into end nappy afro blue
we sw-ing fightin' out the corners
do my tha-a-ang like huey with it nigga

butterfly
the ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
i fumble through my fuzz and buzz mr. i
tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
tell my pops i'm out earthbound with the crew
he said butterfly may the boogie be with you
left my mom's a note with these quotes on a trunk
it says i split to earth to resurrect the funk
a dozen snapple pops and a little box of beats
travelin' through space with the funky funky beats
stopped at pluto to cop some petrol
met some klingons and got our things on
cruisin' warp  with mr. wiggles in the mix
hendrix passin' peas star child get the fix
the saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
because when we hit new york - shazam
we droppin' like a comet and this vulcan tried to spock it
these martians tried to do it but knew they couldn't cop it
the others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
from up in sector  yes y'all

doodlebug
and it's good to be here
when we landed up on lex
stirrin' up the ground with the sound of doug e. fresh
and the hard rockin' kids that did it for the black
with the pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
we learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
we planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
add a ladybug transformation is complete
for the metamorphosis from the box to the jeep

ladybug
and it's good to be here
gettin' fly with the raps
we love it where we from but we kick it where we at
bumpin' out with somethin' that pops and transcends
dps baby it's slim but not thin
in amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
soakin' in the ghetto for kids that have not
slappin' on some skin when we slam check the cheers
so we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
it's so good to be here

all
we jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
and there ain't no doubt that you got to check
doodle silk butter mecc
it's so good to be here

butterfly
yeah baby that's the style
the jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
just ask toy soldier toy soldier could of told you
at the boomin' funk hut it was the afro with the butt
so to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
so see 'em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
get yourself a mate today's to boogie down
this is all we know we feel it when we slams
you could hear the love it comes out in our jams
the hip-hop diggin' cats just deliverin' the words
from the ghetto-dwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
and it's good to be here



butterfly
dps forever hit ya' with the live stuff
suliman the bronx ripper on the live puff

the noise that we made is blue in color sound
toys who played my crew couldn't walk the new ground
or chalk the new sound
a bop like teddy charles was burning
when i excurse on excursions
arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
burnt you with degrees solarly
plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
in the mist with a fist
proletariat cad-i-lac steering it
fro soul gold panther crew grab our poppers
now i'm making bacon
still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
fresh joints we make 'em like water
butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
so i gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down
we symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
grabs in my pockets i release my hot rockets
k.b. said what you give 'em i was like mad rhythm.
that's my junk

the lips with the soul and some jazz for ya hips
the puff the buzz the lids be heavy slick
the mecca get a rush when the beats be very thick
the hands the feet the brown baby treat
the femmes fumble loose and drink the doodlejuice

the boogie gets done the colors won't run
the funk hits the square the kids gotta come
the pizza with the pop the west th stop
the crew after crew that do the grasshop
the true cool is black the new school is fat
the beats by the ounce the funk by the pack
the groove is the fix the jitterbugs fix
the hanging off the butts with the fat sole kicks

whether jeep or lac
peak you as you been there and float to them raps
butterfly's planets for the jam  tracks

jimmi's digging cats and that's just the half
where'd they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
slick just like a lizard
really weird or is it
it's just the logic from how we rocks it
pop shock picks it up and drops its
we the synthesis of then and now melts
channeled to the masses through a dj and some felts
long haired hippies afro blacks
all get together across the tracks
because when we shows up rhythm rolls up
funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
life ain't what it seems life is but a dream
planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
yeah

sample
the song is by some groovy cats
if you can dig
the cats you can dig the song
yeah i can really dig how these cats get down with the
sound as it is today
the way they're bringing it all
together they're cool
brothas are doin it right. and
they're paying good respect to the masters
i can dig it
exactly the way it should be

never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
cooler like i'm offa codeine low key
don't be so judgmental even though i'm reminiscing
if i don't know what i miss is
i'ma end up figuring out that it's home
and my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
this is just a testament to the ones that raised me

like my ex girl getting pregnant
and her becoming my everything

i never forged it or forfeited i'm a force to be reconciled
they want four minute songs
you need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
i'm feeling shortness of breath so nico grab you a horn
hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh

verse
kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
the richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
spineless bitches in backless dresses
wore my feelings on my sleeveless
my weed seedless my trees leafless
i miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
and back when mike jackson was still jesus
before i believed in not believing in
yeah i inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
my big homie died young just turned older than him
i seen it happen i seen it happen i see it always
he still be screaming i see his demons in empty hallways
i trip to make the fall shorter
fall quarter was just a tall order
and i'm hungry i'm just not that thirsty
as of late all my verses seem not so verse-y
and all my words just mean controversy
took the team up off my back like that's not your jersey
stressin' pullin' my hair out hoping i don't get picked
all this medicine in me hoping i don't get sick
making all of this money hoping i don't get rich
'cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
sometimes the truth don't rhyme
sometime the lies get millions of views
funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
from your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
i think love is beautiful too
building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
for future hoopers dead from rugers
shooting through the empty alley
could've threw him an alley-oop
helping him do good in school
damn that acid burn when it clean ya
i still miss being a senior
and performing at all those open mic events
eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
and i still get jealous of vic
and vic's still jealous of me
but if you touch my brother
all that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
and the rest of your team
smoking cigarettes to look cooler
i only stop by to look through ya
and i'm only getting greedier
and i'm still mr. youmedia
and i still can't find talent
and i'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
mom still thinks i should go back to school
and justin still thinks i'm good enough
and mama jan still don't take her meds
and i still be asking god to show his face
and i still be asking god to show his face

i am a new man i am sanctified
oh i am holy i have been baptized
i have been born again i am the white light

the big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
in a bag and wrappin' them in saran wrap bandages
tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
so when he says catch up nigga it looks like an accident
um flowing like my pad is the maxiest
my bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
it's the dark skinned nigga kissing bitches in canada
then kicking all out like mr. lawrence did pamela
put her in the chamber all against her wilt chamberlain
i never had a reason nigga i was just ableton
not a fucking logic contradicting dick head
flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
semen-scented cheetah printed tee
in that 'preme five panel i'll repeat it for the season
previous items in the present
with the normal-ass past like i cheated on my team
it's me tried to get that nigga but golf wang
see he did come back though

verse  hodgy beats
to have some type of knowledge that is one perception
but knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
i'm zeus to a kronos cartilage cartridge is boneless
smiles of cowards in lead showers dead spouses in red blouses
children who fled houses on mustang horses and went joustin'
i'm on my robin hood shit robbing in the hood
whips drugs jewels and your pet i'm stealin' your rims
coke diamonds and your vette soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
and salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop

nigga i'm tryna smoke bitch get higher
domo where that flocka flame talking 'bout a lighter
still bang salute me or just shoot me
'cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
yeah my nigga ace will pull the black jack
the king mike g is in the cut with the black mac
we like the mafia bitch don't get to slacking up
and if these haters acting up throw 'em in the aqueduct
free my nigga earl yo i don't really ask for much
but two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

verse  mike g
what the fuck is caution
often i leave 'em flossing in kaws exes next to coffins
lost in translation the dreams you chase
got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
that's great i'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
with rihanna and christina milian bring it on
and travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
three lettermans that ace has been making him
no strays while we catching matinees huh
i'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
i had the top off the gt like toupees
one finger in the air all's fair when crime pays
my grand scheme of things is to be attached
to the game like bitches to their wedding rings
and you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
in the light ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
like the batman logo over gotham rock la to harlem
if you say get 'em mike g then i got 'em
one man squadron nigga i'm a problem
from briggs i got bars and plans to
pimp these polish bitches into pop stars
humanity kills we all suffer from insanity still
and if i said it then it is or it's gonna be real
of 'til i od and i probably will uh

verse  domo genesis
it's still mr. smoke-a-lotta-pot get your baby mommy popped
with my other snobby bop do i love her probably not
know your shit is not as hot as anything i fuckin' drop
bitch i'm in the zone stand alone like macaulay cock
i've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
big wheel was a big deal with the water glocks
now i'm all grown same song just a different waltz
fire what i talk but still cooler than an otter pop
op dom next shit in your wish list
mad sick shit mad dick for your bitches
on some slick shit your mistress on my hit list
and i'm lifted 'til i'm stiff outta this bitch
odd in your motherfuckin' area
blood clots give me five feet 'fore i bury ya
suicide flow let the big wave carry ya
tyler got the mask like he held jim carrey up
and fuck your team ho nigga wassup

cut it short break it down couple pounds roll it up

interlude frank ocean

verse  frank ocean

but just enough for a week my nigga what can i say

i'mma get you this wine the runner just brought the grapes
my brother give it some time morris and day
course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
on the song cut and you could sample the feel
headphone bleed make this shit sound real
used to work the grill fatburger and fries
then i made a mil' and them psychics was liars
now how many fucking crystal balls can i buy and own
humble old me had to flex for the folks
down in muscle beach pumping iron and bone
bumping oldies off my cellular phone

interlude jasper dolphin

verse  jasper dolphin

only on this beat to make my racks grow faster

verse  earl sweatshirt
look for contrast here's a pair of lips
swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
whoops whoops fuckin' all-american terrorist
crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
and me i just spent a year ferrisin'
and lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel so that sterile piss
flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
narrow tight line might impair him since
i made it back to fahrenheit grimey get dinero type
feral fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
la di da di back in here to fuck the party up
raidin' fridges tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
never dollars poppa make it rain hockey pucks
and sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
off the wall loafers four loko and a cobra clutch
vocals bold and rough evoke a ho to pose as drum
and let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
the culprit of the potent punch
scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a folgers cup
or nevada drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
and shittin' like his colon bust
belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
supernova i'm rollin' over the novices
and roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
to escort it to the morgue again lord of lips
bored of this forklift the tippy top best under  list
stormin' the gate ensurin' the bass
scorchin' leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
get at me we savages half a pack of apache
indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
as a matter of fact your swagger is tacky
so see me you can't like crunchy black catchin' a taxi
uh back like lateral passin'
with that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
as an addict i let percocet and xannies relax me
fall back if your paddies is maxi please

this m.a.a.d city i run my nigga

verse  kendrick lamar
brace yourself i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me l boog and yan yan yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly wavin' yo' hand out the window     check yourself
uh warriors and conans hope euphoria can slow dance
with society the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day i was lookin' at him different
that was back when i was nine joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door fuck is up
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up you fuckin' punk
pickin' up the fuckin' pump pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin' from ak's ar's aye y'all   duck
that's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in ' fuck yo' truce
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty just piecin' bgs up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes except
when we in traffic and tragic happens that shit ain't no threat
you movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial i guess

g-yeah how we do

verse  kendrick lamar
fresh outta school 'cause i was a high school grad'
sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
reality struck i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact i got fired 'cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin' the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a.k.a. compton's human sacrifice

interlude mc eiht
g-yeah cocaine weed
niggas been mixin' shit since the 's loc
sherm sticks butt-nakeds
dip make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one time's crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra rosecrans bullis it's compton

verse  mc eiht
i'm still in the hood loc yeah that's cool
shit the hood took me under so i follow the rules
but yeah that's like me i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drive-by's in the hood lately shit

down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah
trip we in the hood still
so loc grab a strap 'cause yeah it's so real yeah
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

verse  kendrick lamar
if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
or see me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat
if i mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill 'em all if they gossip
the children of the corn they vandalizin' the option
of livin' a lie drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive
hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
probably go to the projects i
live inside the belly of the rough compton usa
made me an angel on angel dust what

fell on my face and awoke with a scar
another mistake livin' deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick

i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
you can see that my city found me
then put me on stages to me that's amazin'
to you that's a quick check
with all disrespect let me say this

hook
i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me lord forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink i got my music
i would share it but today i'm yelling
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe

outro
bitch don't kill my vibe
you ain't heard the coast like this in a long time

and they waiting on kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
threes in the air i can see you are in sync
hide your feelings hide your feelings
now what you better do
i'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
walk out the door and they scream it's alive
my new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution

i say bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe

this country is to me a sound
of drum and bass
you close your eyes to look around

verse  kendrick lamar
hail mary jesus and joseph
the great american flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
compulsive disorder sons and daughters
barricaded blocks and borders
look what you taught us
it's murder on my street your street back streets
wall street corporate offices
banks employees and bosses with
homicidal thoughts donald trump's in office
we lost barack and promised to never doubt him again
but is america honest or do we bask in sin
pass the gin i mix it with american blood
then bash him in you crippin' or you married to blood
i'll ask again     oops accident
it's nasty when you set us up
then roll the dice then bet us up
you overnight the big rifles then tell fox to be scared of us
gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
america's reflections of me that's what a mirror does

chorus bono
it's not a place
this country is to me a sound
of drum and bass
you close your eyes to look ar

i was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
take you and your momma to the motherland
i could do it maybe one day
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's alright here in the city
and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice poetic justice
you were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin

doo-doo-d-doo diggy-doo yo

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

verse 
i never knew a luh luh-luh a love like this
gotta be somethin' for me to write this
queen i ain't seen you in a minute
wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
love has no limit let's spend it slow forever
i know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
i ain't gon' assault them    cause i probably did it too
because of you feelings i handle with care
some niggas recognize the light
but they can't handle the glare
you know i ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
if relationship is effort i will match your work
i want to be the one to make you happiest
and hurt you the most
they say the end is near it's important that we close
to the most high
regardless of what happen on him let's rely

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

verse 
it's important we communicate
and tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
i never call you my bitch or even my boo
there's so much in a name and so much more in you
few understand the union of woman and man
and sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
but that's fly by night for you and the sky i write
for in these cold chi night's moon you my light
if heaven had a height you would be that tall
ghetto to coffee shop through you i see that all
let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
for better or worse times i hope to me you call
so i pray every day more than anything
friends will stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family love ain't simple
why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually
granted we known each other for some time
it don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

verse 
it's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and i can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
plus you shit pop when it's time to
thinkin' you fresh suggestin' beats i should rhyme to
at times when i'm lost i try to find you
you know to give me space when it's time to
my heart's dictionary defines you it's love and happiness
truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
the time we committed love it was real good
had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
i know the sex ain't gon' keep you
but as my equal it's how i must treat you
as my reflection in light i'ma lead you
and whatever's right i'ma feed you
digga-da digga-da digga-da digga-digga-da-da
yo i tell you the rest when i see you peace

hook
there are times
when you'll need someone
i will be by your side
there is a light that shines
special for you and me

outro
i'll take my chances
before they pass
pass me by oh darling

verse 
i met this girl when i was  years old
and what i loved most she had so much soul
she was old school when i was just a shorty
never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
on the regular not a church girl she was secular
not about the money those studs was mic-checkin' her
but i respected her she hit me in the heart
a few new york niggas had did her in the park
but she was there for me and i was there for her
pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
and just cool out cool out and listen to her
sittin' on a bone wishin' that i could do her
eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
   cause we related physically and mentally
and she was fun then i'd be geeked when she'd come around
slim was fresh joe when she was underground
original pure untampered a down sister
boy i tell you i miss her

uac yo we gotta be the sure shot

verse 
now periodically i would see
ol' girl at the clubs and at the house parties
she didn't have a body but she started gettin' thick quick
did a couple of videos and became afrocentric
out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
she was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
about my people she was teachin' me
by not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
in a method that was leisurely so easily i approach
she dug my rap that's how we got close
but then she broke to the west coast and that was cool
cause around the same time i went away to school
and i'm a man of expandin' so why should i stand in her way
she probably get her money in l.a.
and she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
she said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
she said afrocentricity was of the past
so she got into r&b hip-house bass and jazz
now black music is black music and it's all good
i wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
cause that was good for her she was becomin' well-rounded
i thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
just havin' fun not worried about anyone
and you could tell by how her titties hung

chorus
a-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
to the beat y'all and you don't stop
a-yes yes y'all and you don't stop

a-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
and to the beat com gotta be the sure shot
a-yes yes y'all and you don't stop
if you don't check it mm-mm bust it bust it

verse 
i might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
once the man got to her he altered her native
told her if she got an image and a gimmick
that she could make money and she did it like a dummy
now i see her in commercials she's universal
she used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
now she be in the burbs lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
and on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
talkin' bout poppin' glocks servin' rocks and hittin' switches
now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
tellin' me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
stressin' how hardcore and real she is
she was really the realest before she got into showbiz
i did her not just to say that i did it
but i'm committed girl he's committed but so many niggas hit it
that she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
i see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
but i'ma take her back hopin' that the shit stop
   cause who i'm talkin' about y'all is hip-hop

chorus

verse  common
hands to the heavens no man no weapon
formed against yes glory is destined
every day women and men become legends
sins that go against our skin become blessings
the movement is a rhythm to us
freedom is like religion to us
justice is juxtapositionin' us
justice for all just ain't specific enough
one son died his spirit is revisitin' us
true and livin' livin' in us resistance is us
that's why rosa sat on the bus
that's why we walk through ferguson with our hands up
when it go down we woman and man up

verse  common
selma is now for every man woman and child
even jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
they marched with the torch we gon' run with it now
never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
from dark roads he rose to become a hero
facin' the league of justice his power was the people
enemy is lethal a king became regal
saw the face of jim crow under a bald eagle
the biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
we sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
now we right the wrongs in history
no one can win the war individually
it takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
welcome to the story we call victory
the comin' of the lord my eyes have seen the glory

chorus
one day when the glory comes
it will be ours it will be ours
one day when the war is won

loving you is loving me

verse 
yeah you know what love is
even found it on the ground where the thugs live
my man had to dig deep to find his
couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
live nig's real niggas express and taste it
at crap games black dames and big faces
cases in court fam' showing love and support
you and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
as men we were taught to hold it in
that's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
if love is a place i'ma go again
at least now now i know to go within
at times it can take ya for a spin
heartbreak hotel then you're home again
i've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
like a story that he don't want to end
yo

hook

verse 
it's all love where we come from
in the hood love we was told to run from
that same hood where the guns sung
we holla love hoping it'd become one
crack got so many lives undone
from lack of love many hide some run
i knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
trying to find herself again much of that she'd have gave
love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
funny we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
wonder if a thug is raw is he actin' afraid
everybody loves sun why do i attract shade
heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
what it is to be loved by a man

hook

verse 
some say that i'm a dreamer cause i talk about it often
seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
we walk and stand in fall in it
with the right companion we all in it
mary sang a song about it having broad limits
in the game of life it's the scrimmage
reminiscing on letters i wrote in my small days
a letter to the people love always
yeah

i'm killing spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system
say it then i do it i never missed 'em
fuck 'em after i kissed 'em sit back and listen
my chain it glisten it's like i'm from another dimension
did i mention my circle's smaller than an intervention
then some beautiful women tell me i'm handsome
then i snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
i fuck 'em until inside they belly burst
stop it drop the beat and then we cue the verse
spitting lyrics like how a mac- really disperse
slaughter mcs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
they say i got too many styles bitch i've been diverse
they scared to jump in the cypher i be all up in it first
my apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse

do i find it so hard
when i know in my heart
i'm letting you down every day
letting you down every day
why do i keep on running away

verse  jay-z
look i apologize often womanize
took for my child to be born see through a woman's eyes
took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
took me too long for this song i don't deserve you
i harassed you out in paris
please come back to rome you make it home
we talked for hours when you were on tour
   please pick up the phone pick up the phone   
i said    don't embarrass me    instead of    be mine   
that was my proposal for us to go steady
that was your st birthday
you matured faster than me i wasn't ready
so i apologize
i seen the innocence leave your eyes
i still mourn this death and
i apologize for all the stillborns cause i wasn't present
your body wouldn't accept it
i apologize to all the women whom i toyed with your emotions
'cause i was emotionless
and i apologize 'cause at your best you are love
and because i fall short of what i say i'm all about
your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
and you stare blankly into space
thinkin' of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
so i apologize

chorus hannah williams
i'm never gonna treat you
i'm never gonna treat you like i should
ohhhhhh

verse  jay-z
i apologize our love was one for the ages and i contained us
and all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
or sleep with our back turned
we supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
we're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
and then meet in a space where the dark stop
and let love light the way
like the men before me i cut off my nose to spite my face
i never wanted another woman to know
something about me that you didn't know
i promised i cried i couldn't hold
i suck at love i think i need a do-over
i will be emotionally available if i invited you over
i stew over what if you over my shit

chorus hannah williams
i'm never gonna treat you
i'm never gonna treat you like i should
ohhhhhh

verse  jay-z
and if my children knew
i don't even know what i would do
if they ain't look at me the same
i would prob'ly die with all the shame
you did what with who
what good is a m  nage    trois when you have a soulmate
you risked that for blue
if i wasn't a superhero in your face
my heart breaks for the day i have to explain my mistakes
and the mask goes away
and santa claus is fake
and you go online and see
for blue's tooth the tooth fairy didn't pay

they send me to a level three yard that's where i stay
late night i hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
niggas getting they shanks just in case the war pops off

went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said um mirror mirror on the wall
who is the top dog of them all
there was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
the mirror said you are you conceited bastard
well that's true that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put some bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean dry was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh dressed like a million bucks
threw on my white socks with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house stopped short oh no

i bumped into this smoker named sally from the valley
this was a girl playing hard-to-get

cause you took your dope away from me

verse 
damn now what was i to do
she's crying over me and she was feelin blue
i said um don't cry dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys
her mean mother steps then says to me hi
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong the kids was gone
something was wrong i said what was goin on
i tried to break it up i said stop it just leave her
she said if i can't smoke none she can't either
she grabbed me closely by my socks
so i broke the hell out and i grabbed my sack of rocks

my god you pay for your friends i'll take that as a compliment
got a house full of homies why i feel so the opposite
incompetent ain't the half of it

verse 
i used to care what people thought but now i care more
i mean nobody out here's got it figured out
so therefore i've lost all hope of a happy ending
depending on whether or not it's worth it so insecure no one's perfect
we spend it with no shame we blow that like coltrane
we in here like rogaine or leave it like cobain
and when i'm long gone whole crew sing a swan song
cause we all just ticking time bombs got a lambo like lebron's mom
and no matter where all of my friends go emily fam and lorenzo
all of them people my kinfolk at least i think so can't tell
cause when them checks clear they're not here
cause they don't care it's kinda sad but i'm laughing whatever happens
assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
labrador yapping i'm glad that it happened i mean it
between us i think there's something special and if i lose my mental
just hold my hand even if you don't understand hold up

the other night
lavish lee told me that i'm all these people listen to
she said they love me unconditional
imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
you know that if you wasn't you you would be dissin' you dawg
damn okay from that perspective
i see what you're talkin' 'bout no way to soften that
'cause me i was tryna find out where i lost 'em at
but maybe i ain't lose 'em at all
maybe i keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
they ain't movin' at all
but when they need a favor who do they call
maybe i'm searchin' for the problems
askin' what was said and who was involved
too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot it's on
these days feel like i'm squeezin' in 'em
whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
i'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'cause if i run in the game in these man the seams are splittin'
no pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
headed where nobody took it who meetin' me there
they tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
listen up boy you're better off eavesdroppin'
we already got spring  poppin'
pnd droppin' reps-up p droppin'
majid jordan droppin' ob droppin' not to mention me droppin'
feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
me and noel been at it before twitter names
yeah been on the move like the lease is up
and i can't even name one person that's keepin' up
damn fuck how it was in the past tense
ask yourself how do we match up now
'cause i'm only  and i'm only gettin' better
if i haven't passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

you in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
when we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
the ramen noodle
your simple voodoo is so maniacal we're liable to pull a juju
the irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
she don't love me she make money she don't study that
she gon' give it to me ain't gon' tell me run it back
she gon' take the brain to wetter plains she spit on that
the doors have signs with don't try to rhyme with
vh has a show that you can waste your time with
guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
and for a salary i'd probably do that shit sporadically
the og gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
the irs piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl

better yet street smarts but you keep us off the charts
so motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians

the only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
we got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
boy i tell you that's vision
like tony romo when he hitting witten

'cause i love it when you wack mc's despise me
they get vexed i roll next can't none contest me
i'm just a fly mc who's five foot three and very brave
on top remaining no home training 'cause i misbehave
i come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check

no shame in my game cause i'll always be the same
styles upon styles upon styles is what i have
you wanna diss the phifer but you still don't know the half
i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
i never half step cause i'm not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr. pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name ain't special ed
so won't you seckle with the mission
i never walk the street thinking it's all about me
even though deep in my heart it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

verse  q-tip
zulu nation brothers last creation
minds get flooded ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
to get my point across so bust the floss
as i go in between the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work umm
as i crack the monotone
children of the jazz so get your own
smokin r&b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they can't do rap

yo when you bug out
you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding always surrounding
pulsing just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
you soar off to another world deep in your mind
but people seem to take that as being unkind
oh yo he's acting stank really on a regal
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nike's
if a crowd is in my realm i'm saying -- mic please
hip-hop is living can't yank the plug
if you do the result will end up kind of bugged

verse  q-tip
yo i am not an invalid although
i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
when i left for road see i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his maddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world
or was it just because i used to
swipe the women and all the girls
i'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man

a lower plateau is what we're above

we ended our hiatus the dogs looking for food

toleration for devastation got a hunger for sin
every nation obama nation let the coroner in
crooked faces red and blue laces for the color of men
just embrace it and die alone song of revelation

fumigate our economy 'lluminate broken dreams

verse  butterfly
we like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
then they got moved by these hard-rock brooklyn kids
us floor rush when the dj's booming classics
you dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
he touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
she frequents the fattest joints caught underground
our funk zooms like you hit the mary jane
they flock to booms man boogie had to change
who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
when butterfly rocked his light blue-suede pumas
what by the cut we push it off the corner
how was the buzz entire hip hop era
was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
the poobah of the styles like miles and shit
like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
just sendin' chunky rhythms right down ya block
we be to rap what key be to lock

where i'm from it be like run your coat black
jupiter keeps her fat beats by the pack
where i'm from nappy hair is life
we be reading marx where i'm from
the kids be rocking clarks where i'm from
you turn around your cap you talk over a beat
and dig some sounds booming out a jeep
where i'm from cocoons hide the youth swoon units hundred proof
you want some beef they will cut you some where i'm from
the beats is infinite where i'm from
voodoo ashubani gangsta lean where i'm from
i'm interplanetary my insect movements vary
it's kinky if it's hair g where i'm from
the fire hoses blow
it's purple when it snow
i do a hit and go split
it's hip what's hip
when hip is just the norm
cause planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
the kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
my grandmother told my mama that it's africa at work
on vibes we freak them universal beats
you find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
we twist exist to spin the maddest hits
up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
the lip we sip can't house the nine zips
for rock we can't do nothing for this we come equipped
off disc off tape rap blasting til from eight
the really truly fat the fly on the flip
cocoa gotta know how planets gotta roll
speak the mega cool get funky as a goal
it's calm relax we're only some new jacks
that acts from the funk but don't play the role

verse  ladybug
venus acts a fool at the square right yeah
doctors engineer in a pair right yeah
hip-hop made a point last year right yeah
but planets is the joint this year right yeah
planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hip-hop
rising like we foam get it from the dome
i'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
we can get a kit without no thread
feeling funky beats go straight to the head
fall into a club dig on what we love
it be past six before we reach bed
butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
doodle mecc and silk the quad where it's at
we need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
so we treat our clips just like busting caps
rip it till dawn kick it till dawn
hip-hop is the fix or else we be gone
people thought they canned it
rap is not by bandits
digable planets got it going on

i was raised in the ways of the manchu clan
and five elements posture take a b-boy stance
with the gold front shining baggy pants sagging
this brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
but i'm climbing finding new ways of rhyming
not living like a star it's strictly bout surviving
diving deep into the grooves of the ghetto
this downtown flavor shines from many angles
yes the notorious with rhymes so glorious
the manchu monkey over flunkies is victorious
rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
lyrical skills of the insect in motion
coasting down fulton with a bag of magic potion
now i'm rolling with the seven and the crescents
puffing some expression
manifesting today's lessons
stressing the fact that i'm solar guaranteed to go far
cause the mind is interstellar
still peace like that so have no fear
but i'm slicker this year

verse  ishmael butler
butterfly searching for a relax
pulling from the jazz stacks cause it's sunday
on the air is incense sounds to the ceiling
tried to get this feeling since monday
looking out the window watching all the people go
bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems they're equal
wonder what would trane say wonder what my pop say
bugging off the calmness in the apple
who me i'm cooling in new york
i'm chilling in new york
the hoods is on my block and the brother's at the court
the baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
dreamtime's extended and highly recommended
but early birds like me's up checking out the scene
the early worms jog forget about your job
just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
when people act like people the theory is in pigeon
if you know the norm it's like hades transformed
on sunday's early hours the city sprouts its flowers
so get with the rhythms while you getting with the planets
vibe off the jams but don't take em for granted just chill

refrain
new york is red hot new york is red hot
new york is red hot new york is red hot

verse  mary ann vieira and craig irving
we venture through the streets in search of funky beats
extensive is the travels and it's heavy on the sneaks
ye it's kicking out the speakers of the sunday morning jeepers
my man do planets do it lovely
am i my brother's keeper
we foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
and sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
hanging with the rebels sipping on a snapple
bugging with my crew just tripping in the apple
you be thinking peace when you're vibing with your flock
but you be thinking damn everybody got a glock
if you got some beef please express that in silence
or else violence
but right here is the life it's the children of the concrete
living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
hip-hop's all around the members is growing
please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing so chill

refrain
new york is red hot new york is red hot
new york is red hot new york is red hot
new york is red hot new york is red hot
new york is red hot new york is red hot

verse  ishmael butler
wake up praying that the game's on
maybe it's the running rebs maybe it's the knicks
maybe it's a rerun of an old tv show
like hawaii - or karate flicks
maybe if the phone rings butterfly will take wings
speaking on some cool things fronting like i cope
born unto flat ground now i'm chilling shaky ground
reaching for pacific heights sunday is my rope dig it
sunday's to relax
sunday's to relax
some sunday morning drama is calling up my mama
the hot line is in i guess the silvers knew the deal
vibing off the jams of the crews on sugarhill
lay around and think ain't nothing to do
checking out some fromm some sartre camus
mingus' ah um damn roach can drum
the dp's are life there they go here they come
it's time to grab some loot put on the timber boots
checking out some dali's like tasha and kamali
new york is a museum with its posters and graffiti
if you're in the city on sunday
come check me get with me

butterfly
it was  on a beautiful th day of july
there was not a cloud to speak of so the orange sun hung
lonely in the sky
i lay prone in my catbeat home
listening to fine nappy jackie and his jazzcat's horn
sliding in a tape of bird on verve when suddenly rang my phone
hey butterfly the voice said
slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
the vibe here is very pleasant and i truly request your presence
a problem of great magnitude has arose
and as we speak it grows
damn what could it be i thought
a juice i bought and rolled on down to her spot
seeing bros i know slapping fives i arrived and pressed g-
and there was nikki
lookin' some kind of sad with tears fallin' from her eyes
she sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down
you remember my boyfriend sid that fly kid who i love
well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
but due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate
about this we don't feel great but baby that's how it is
but the feds have dissed me
they ignored and dismissed me
the pro-lifers harass me outside the clinic
and call me a murderer now that's hate
so needless to say we're in a mental state of debate
hey beautiful bird i said digging her somber mood
the fascists are some heavy dudes
they don't really give a damn about life
they just don't want a woman to control her body
or have the right to choose
but baby that ain't nothin'
they just want a male finger on the button
because if you say war they will send them to die by the score
aborting mission should be your volition
but if souter and thomas have their way
you'll be standing in line unable to get welfare while they'll be out
hunting and fishing
it has always been around it will always have a niche
but they'll make it a privilege not a right
accessible only to the rich
hey pro-lifers need to dig themselves
because life doesn't stop after birth
and for a child born to the unprepared
it might even just get worse
the situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it
supporters of the h-bomb and fire-bombing clinics
what type of shit is that orwellian in fact
if roe v. wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
leaving young girls to risk their healths
and doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
i don't want to sound macabre
but hey isn't it my job
to lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
to fight against these fascists
so whatever you decide make that move with pride
sid will be there and so will i
an insect 'til i die

rhythms and sounds
spinning around
confrontations
across the nation
your block
my block
dreadlocks
what a shock
land of the free
but not me not me



cop

verse  ladybug mecca
so now lets let into in my pocket pack
pummel and i epic black ethic lack
i walk again you were shade gray come display
mazes in black fire in the west

up the fort where i'm caught
and my thought to shakin' up a few loose
now i let my cause shoot krs one
cause we fade in and out are you swinging or coming
i'm solid on this thought this ain't living

verse  doodlebug
i got harlem on my mind darren on my back
brooklyn in my blood and butter's on the track
i got insect thoughts catch the cool ways
clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
the jazz the jive the poetry
the style the lingo the bags of equality
many different things try to get to me
but in a world of hard rock i keep my humility
the funkanaut from the kingdom of not
with galactic sure shot they can't won't don't stop
flock to the rhythm i bring
sing songs call survival on the mingus revival
scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
it's doodlebug give me love for a visual script
sip the groove juice it's kind of rough
sevens never bluff i had enough eleven

verse  butterfly
in the east i rose
froze in the pose
of a land diseased
flows that cooler summer breeze
nikki did kevin's braids we got four in the 'lac
as we swoop at warp seven holler don't crowd cats
cause look corpie is the color and butter he do it low
all you hear is poppers and rubber i'm saying oh
man we keep it popping on hot days
shit i got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
and i dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
i'm fro blow got that right
groove with soul and i'm still spinnin'
cross  and indicate them something else
blackest space deepest sea
scoff my shit's a natural high the man can't put no thing on me
now catch me when my mind stretch out it's astro black
time reaching into end nappy afro blue
we sw-ing fightin' out the corners

butterfly
the ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
i fumble through my fuzz and buzz mr. i
tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
tell my pops i'm out earthbound with the crew
he said butterfly may the boogie be with you
left my mom's a note with these quotes on a trunk
it says i split to earth to resurrect the funk
a dozen snapple pops and a little box of beats
travelin' through space with the funky funky beats
stopped at pluto to cop some petrol
met some klingons and got our things on
cruisin' warp  with mr. wiggles in the mix
hendrix passin' peas star child get the fix
the saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
because when we hit new york - shazam
we droppin' like a comet and this vulcan tried to spock it
these martians tried to do it but knew they couldn't cop it
the others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
from up in sector  yes y'all

doodlebug
and it's good to be here
when we landed up on lex
stirrin' up the ground with the sound of doug e. fresh
and the hard rockin' kids that did it for the black
with the pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
we learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
we planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
add a ladybug transformation is complete
for the metamorphosis from the box to the jeep

ladybug
and it's good to be here
gettin' fly with the raps
we love it where we from but we kick it where we at
bumpin' out with somethin' that pops and transcends
dps baby it's slim but not thin
in amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
soakin' in the ghetto for kids that have not
slappin' on some skin when we slam check the cheers
so we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
it's so good to be here

all
we jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
and there ain't no doubt that you got to check
doodle silk butter mecc
it's so good to be here

butterfly
yeah baby that's the style
the jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
just ask toy soldier toy soldier could of told you
at the boomin' funk hut it was the afro with the butt
so to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
so see 'em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
get yourself a mate today's to boogie down
this is all we know we feel it when we slams
you could hear the love it comes out in our jams
the hip-hop diggin' cats just deliverin' the words
from the ghetto-dwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
and it's good to be here

butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
so i gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down

planets kinda funky as if you hadn't guessed
placebos getting blocked funky joints get rocked
jive is not found
we fly from the flesh
whether jeep or lac
peak you as you been there and float to them raps
butterfly's planets for the jam  tracks
from the -tops with the twists and plaits
look beneath my hat

cool is back give some skin lay it on me
groovy you could call it

sweetback chills with shaft on the ave
jimmi's digging cats and that's just the half
where'd they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
slick just like a lizard
really weird or is it
it's just the logic from how we rocks it
pop shock picks it up and drops its
we the synthesis of then and now melts
channeled to the masses through a dj and some felts
long haired hippies afro blacks
all get together across the tracks
because when we shows up rhythm rolls up
funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
life ain't what it seems life is but a dream
planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
yeah

sample
the song is by some groovy cats
if you can dig
the cats you can dig the song
yeah i can really dig how these cats get down with the
sound as it is today
the way they're bringing it all
together they're cool
brothas are doin it right. and
they're paying good respect to the masters
i can dig it
exactly the way it should be

intro
it's the ten crack commandments what
nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
can't tell me nothing about this crack this weed my hustlin' niggas
niggas on the corner i ain't forget you niggas my triple beam niggas

verse 
i've been in this game for years it made me a animal
there's rules to this shit i wrote me a manual
a step-by-step booklet for you to get
your game on track not your wig pushed back
rule nombre uno never let no one know
how much dough you hold cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
if that man fucked up get yo' ass stuck up
number  never let 'em know your next move
don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence
take it from your highness
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
number  never trust nobody
your moms'll set that ass up properly gassed up
hoodied and masked up shit for that fast buck
she be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
number  i know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply
number  never sell no crack where you rest at
i don't care if they want a ounce tell 'em bounce
number  that goddamn credit dead it
you think a crackhead paying you back shit forget it
 this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely separated
money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
number  never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
number  shoulda been number  to me
if you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
if niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
they be sittin' in your kitchen waiting to start hittin'
number  a strong word called consignment
strictly for live men not for freshmen
if you ain't got the clientele say hell no
cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
if not  years on the wake up
slug hit your temple watch your frame shake up
caretaker did your makeup when you passed
your girl fucked my man jake up
heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half of cake up
heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
gotta go gotta go more pies to bake up word up

crack king frank wiz-zhite

verse  the notorious b.i.g.
after realizin' to master enterprisin'
i ain't have to be in school by ten i then
began to encounter with my counterparts
on how to burn the block apart break it down into sections
drugs by the selections
some use pipes others use injections
syringe sold separately frank the deputy
quick to grab my smith & wesson like my dick was missin'
to protect my position my corner my lair
while we out here say the hustlers prayer
if the game shakes me or breaks me
i hope it makes me a better man take a better stand
put money in my mom's hand
get my daughter this college grant
so she don't need no man
stay far from timid only make moves when your heart's in it
and live the phrase sky's the limit

and a little girl named corin

verse 
some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
i say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
i give a holla to my sisters on welfare
pac cares if don't nobody else care
and i know they like to beat you down a lot
when you come around the block brothers clown a lot
but please don't cry dry your eyes never let up
forgive but don't forget girl keep ya head up
and when he tells you you ain't nothin' don't believe him
and if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
   cause sister you don't need him
and i ain't tryin' to gas you up i just call 'em how i see 'em
you know what makes me unhappy
when brothers make babies
and leave a young mother to be a pappy
and since we all came from a woman
got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
i wonder why we take from our women
why we rape our women     do we hate our women
i think it's time to kill for our women
time to heal our women be real to our women
and if we don't we'll have a race of babies
that will hate the ladies that make the babies
and since a man can't make one
he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
so will the real men get up
i know you're fed up ladies but keep ya head up

hook
keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
things'll get brighter
keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
things'll get brighter

verse 
ayo i remember marvin gaye used to sing to me
he had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
and suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
and though we had it rough we always had enough
i huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
and i realize mama really paid the price
she nearly gave her life to raise me right
and all i had to give her was my pipe dream
of how i'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
i'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
it's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
and in the end it seems i'm headin' for the pen
i try to find my friends but they're blowin' in the wind
last night my buddy lost his whole family
it's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
it seems the rain'll never let up
i try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
you know it's funny when it rains it pours
they got money for wars but can't feed the poor
say there ain't no hope for the youth
and the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
and then they wonder why we crazy
i blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
we ain't meant to survive    cause it's a set-up
and even though you're fed up huh you got to keep ya head up

hook
keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
things'll get brighter
keep ya head up ooh child
things are gonna get easier
keep ya head up ooh child
things'll get brighter

verse 
and uh to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
i know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
thank the lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
   cause i think we can make it in fact i'm sure
and if you fall stand tall and come back for more
   cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
you can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin' helpless
because there's too many things for you to deal with
dyin' inside but outside you're lookin' fearless
while tears is rollin' down your cheeks
you steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
   cause if it did you couldn't take it
and don't blame me     i was given this world i didn't make it
and now my son's gettin' older and older
and colder from havin' the world on his shoulders
while the rich kids is drivin' benz
i'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
and it's crazy it seems it'll never let up
but please you got to keep ya head up

killuminati the  days



verse  pac
i see no changes wake up in the morning and i ask myself
is life worth livin' should i blast myself
i'm tired of bein' poor and even worse i'm black
my stomach hurts so i'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
first ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
it's time to fight back that's what huey said
two shots in the dark now huey's dead
i got love for my brother
but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
we gotta start makin' changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
how can the devil take a brother if he's close to me
i'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things change    and that's the way it is

hook talent
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is aww yeah
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is aww yeah

verse  pac
i see no changes all i see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
we under i wonder what it takes to make this
one better place let's erase the wasted
take the evil out the people they'll be actin' right
   cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
and the only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real time to heal each other
and although it seems heaven-sent
we ain't ready to see a black president
it ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
but some things will never change
try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
now tell me what's a mother to do
bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
you gotta operate the easy way
i made a g today but you made it in a sleazy way
sellin' crack to the kids
i gotta get paid     well hey but that's the way it is

hook talent
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is aww yeah
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is aww yeah

interlude pac
we gotta make a change
it's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
let's change the way we eat
let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other
you see the old way wasn't workin'
so it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

verse  pac
and still i see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
it's war on the streets and a war in the middle east
instead of war on poverty
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
and i ain't never did a crime i ain't have to do
but now i'm back with the facts givin' it back to you
don't let 'em jack you up back you up
crack you up and pimp-smack you up
you gotta learn to hold your own
they get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
but tell the cops they can't touch this
i don't trust this when they try to rush i bust this
that's the sound of my tool
you say it ain't cool my mama didn't raise no fool
and as long as i stay black i gotta stay strapped
and i never get to lay back
   cause i always got to worry 'bout the payback
some buck that i roughed up way back
comin' back after all these years
rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is

hook talent
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is aww yeah
you're my brother you're my sister
that's just the way it is
things'll never be the same
that's just the way it is aww yeah

outro pac
some things'll never change



verse  pac
when i was young me and my mama had beef
seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face
ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
suspended from school and scared to go home i was a fool
with the big boys breakin' all the rules
i shed tears with my baby sister over the years
we was poorer than the other little kids
and even though we had different daddies the same drama
when things went wrong we'd blame mama
i reminisce on the stress i caused it was hell
huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
and who'd think in elementary hey
i'd see the penitentiary one day
and runnin' from the police that's right
mama catch me put a whoopin' to my backside
and even as a crack fiend mama
you always was a black queen mama
i finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
you always was committed
a poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it
there's no way i can pay you back but the plan
is to show you that i understand you are appreciated

hook reggie green & sweet franklin   pac
lady don't you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady don't you know we love ya

verse  pac
now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
no love from my daddy    cause the coward wasn't there
he passed away and i didn't cry    cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
they say i'm wrong and i'm heartless but all along
i was lookin' for a father he was gone
i hung around with the thugs
and even though they sold drugs
they showed a young brother love
i moved out and started really hangin'
i needed money of my own so i started slangin'
i ain't guilty    cause even though i sell rocks
it feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
i love payin' rent when the rent is due
i hope you got the diamond necklace that i sent to you
   cause when i was low you was there for me
and never left me alone because you cared for me
and i could see you comin' home after work late
you're in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
you just workin' with the scraps you was given
and mama made miracles every thanksgivin'
but now the road got rough you're alone
you're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
and there's no way i can pay you back but my plan
is to show you that i understand you are appreciated

hook reggie green & sweet franklin   pac
lady don't you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady don't you know we love ya

verse  pac
pour out some liquor and i reminisce
   cause through the drama i can always depend on my mama
and when it seems that i'm hopeless
you say the words that can get me back in focus
when i was sick as a little kid
to keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
and all my childhood memories
are full of all the sweet things you did for me
and even though i act crazy
i gotta thank the lord that you made me
there are no words that can express how i feel
you never kept a secret always stayed real
and i appreciate how you raised me
and all the extra love that you gave me
i wish i could take the pain away
if you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
everything will be alright if you hold on
it's a struggle every day gotta roll on
and there's no way i can pay you back but my plan
is to show you that i understand you are appreciated

hook reggie green & sweet franklin   pac
lady don't you know we love ya dear mama
sweet lady place no one above ya you are appreciated
sweet lady don't you know we love ya dear mama

verse  pac
now we was once two niggas of the same kind
quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
you was just a little smaller but you still rolled
got stretched to y.a. and hit the hood swoll
'member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
on the block wit'cha glock trippin' off sherm
collect calls to the crib sayin' how you've changed
oh you a muslim now no more dope game
heard you might be comin' home just got bail
wanna go to the mosque don't wanna chase tail
it seems i lost my little homie he's a changed man
hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
when i talk about money all you see is the struggle
when i tell you i'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
congratulations on the weddin' i hope your wife know
she got a playa for life and that's no bullshittin'
i know we grew apart you probably don't remember
i used to fiend for your sister but never went up in her
and i can see us after school we'd bomb
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
and i can't even trip 'cause i'm just laughin' at cha
you tryin' hard to maintain then go ahead 'cause i ain't mad at cha

verse  pac
we used to be like distant cousins fightin' playin' dozens
whole neighborhood buzzin' knowin' that we wasn't
used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
i'm gettin' blitzed and i reminisce on all the times we shared
besides bumpin' and grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
in time we'd learned to live a life of crime
rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
i caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
and even though we separated you said that you'd wait
don't give nobody no coochie while i'll be locked up state
i kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
said i'll return but i gotta fight the fate's arrived
don't shed a tear 'cause mama i ain't happy here
i blew trial no more smiles for a couple years
they got me goin' mad i'm knockin' busters on they backs
in my cell thinkin' hell i know one day i'll be back.
as soon as i touch down
i told my girl i'd be there so prepare to get fucked down
the homies wanna kick it but i'm just laughin' at cha

well guess who's movin' up this nigga's ballin' now

he went from nothin' to lots ten carats to rock
went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
he's mr. local-celebrity addicted to movin' ki's
most hated by enemies escape in the luxury
see first you was our nigga but you made it so the choice is made
now we gotta slay you while you faded in the younger days
so full of pain while the weapons blaze
gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it to the better days
'cause crime pays and in time you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
so many changed on me so many tried to plot
that i keep a glock beside my head when will it stop
'til god return me to my essence
'cause even as an adolescent i refused to be a convalescent
so many questions and they ask me if i'm still down
i moved up out of the ghetto so i ain't real now
they got so much to say but i'm just laughin' at cha

then forget it in turn these critics and interns

i know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
but you not passionate about half the shit that you into and i ain't havin' it
and we both know that i don't mean to offend you i'm just focused today
and i don't know why it's difficult to admit that i miss you
and i don't know why we argue and i just hope that you listen
and if i hurt you i'm sorry the music makes me dismissive
when i'm awake i'm just drifting i'm not complaining
it's just to say that i stay pretty busy lately
and i could be misbehaving i just hang with my niggas
i'm fuckin' famous if you forgot i'm faithful
despite all what's in my face and my pocketand this is painfully honest
and when i say it i vomit on cloudy days when i'm salty
i play the hate to the logic
state to state for the profit it ain't a stain on me nigga
my momma raised me a profit i play for dollar incentive
and where i'm walking it's studded and half-retarded i stumble
to where she park when she visit i grab the bottle and chug it
i see the car in the distance i know the dark isn't coming
for the moment if i could hold it
she she seems that

i emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you think   s cool
they thought me soft in high school thank god i   m jagged
forgot you don   t like it rough i mean he called me a faggot
i was just calling his bluff
i mean how anal am i gon' be when i   m aiming my gun
and why   s his mug all bloody that was a three on one

sent to earth to poke catholics in the ass with saws
and knock blunt ashes into their caskets and laugh it off
twisted sicker than mad cattle in fact i'm off
six different liquors with a prince wig plastered on
stop screaming bitch you shouldn't be that alarmed
when big lips is in the attic armed with an addict's arm
earl puts the ass in assassin
puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
it so happens that i'm so haphazardous
i'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
i'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
and get a hall pass for this class-act shit
how the fuck i fit an axe in a satchel
slip capsules in a glass she dizzy rascal
party staff baffled asking where her ass go
in my room redefining the meaning of black holes
go on suck it up but hurry i got nuts to bust
and butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
it's o.f. buttercup go ahead fuck with us
without a doubt a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
ask her for a couple bucks shove a trumpet up her butt
play a song invade her thong
my dick is having guts for lunch as well as supper
then i'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
found the mustard
fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
what you doing     nothing much
would shout some other stuff
got to fucking bounce guess the bouncer's had enough of us

advanced apathy smashing the man cameras up

don't give a fuck pardon me for going into details

we had females come in every hour on the dot
and the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
focused on my chatter ain't as frantic as my thoughts

feeling like i'm stranded in a mob scrambling for xanax out the canister to pop
never getting out of hand
steady handling my job time damaging my ties
who turn to get up get dude turned to dinner quick
you circus niggas you turning into tricks

if he ain't dying for me then i ain't riding with him
there's no time for that
making sure my man wallet's straight

i got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with uncle mervin
fuckin' y'all with no lubricant go grab the detergent
i preach to demons at your church now i'm the newest sermon
wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
i drive through white suburbans in the black suburban swervin'
hittin' curbs and blastin' erick sermon drunk off english bourbon
i'm stealin' purses rapin' nurses i'm a crooked surgeon
and treat the beat like sanitized nazi puss i'm a german
i'm squirtin' while i'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
from eatin' miley cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'
my only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
so bitches hate to do me like ex-convict community service
this my zombie circus you better get a fuckin' ticket
odd future wolf gang like they're filmin' twilight in this bitch

verse  earl
i'm back on my sixty six sick shit
flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
she lick it up dracula then spit it back back at ya
she mad as fuck stuck in the back of a black acura
fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
hello heather yellow feathers now you ain't laughin' huh

verse  tyler
bitch you're barely breathin' leavin' on the back of the boat
while i fill you up with semen from the wolf gang team and
flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
oughta eat the bitch with salt & wash it down with a gallon of water
i grab the saw and sawed off her arm and auctioned it
and dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
fuckin' awesome spittin' box of trees got you niggas
shakin' like it's parkinsons from the clitoris of kelly clarkson's dick
ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
find earl laying on the burgundy carpet pull my knife out
sharpen it stab him put a arch on it
pour unleaded gas on him get the zippo and spark the shit
hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
killed him on his own track the faggot shouldn't have started it



verse  tyler the creator
after filling my reputation of whore beaters
soared to taco bell and i ordered some gorditas
mmm that's good wanted four more ordered em then eat em
then head to thebe's house for some gymnastics
fantastic i backflip on this beat b
cause we running shit like the dingleberries on four cheetahs
flow colder than papa joe's old domino's
fuck it whatever
um... trashwang scratched inside the knucks
got some one direction tickets i should hit that up
drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
move over the microwave and the cannabis
try to take the van and the whole band to canada
fuck the block news and the venues they can't handle us
they can't stand us including fruits that frank's channeling
the ku klux klan see me and my managers
but thank me when they ask where the five panels is
man i suck now i ain't still dope
but chris and rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
oh fuck i went there balling bitch i'm ben's hair
y'all barely breaking like taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
old navy bitches love this gap yeah this grin's rare
watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
i'm kicking it with nak and the nigga from green mile it's
red bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
that's just all the sherm i was burning a little while ago
don't let me get hold of that rifle
shout my nigga sage elsseser and sean pablo
surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
and some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
they never did catch that rhino

verse  earl sweatshirt
squadron full of some lost souls
sergeant of all it's autumn and nak just nollied a pothole
non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
and coppers labeled a  problem since paying for damianos
so shimmy through the swamp nigga follow me through the foxholes
moral orenthal with a pretty bitch in a bronco
hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some vatos
threw a punch got jumped dusted off and then walked home
shit it's like  p.m. and his temple throbbing
hand in the cabinet by seven sniff the prescription oxies
logo in the boxes all my niggas hostile
cautious of your crosses scoffing at your doctrines
bitches augmented stupid as the group is only slightly
write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped
man these stitches shut the loose lips stumbled in a ruth's chris
slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
see lionel ball with leonardo on the weekend now
and maui on a scenic route we on the second season now
small fry got 'em seasons salty weeded coughing
ease up off me end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
from a different breed of doggy from a different seed and cloth
and teeing off believe it's golf wang nigga

search inside my purse to buy something worthless

verse 
 problems all gone in that one joint
and that neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
i'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
with a duffel full of troubles trunk rattle in the mazda
ragged with the contra phantom of the opera
and i'm standing on the cop's truck stacking for the long run
the bags packed roadside with the thumb out
toe tagged don't gag fag spit your gum out
nomadic chrome-grabbing when it's danger
i'm a manger-born puppy holding flight like a hangar do
knife to the trachea spit scabies and bet
the label don't like me but they pay me a grip
and you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
y'all niggas busy play-dohing bet the baker came swinging like

like fuck is beef get your cattle cut pansy
if them fans only local why them flights trans-atlantied up
the rice and the patty's cooked nice for the chancellor
them teeth with the gold bright the light switches mad at us
snap chatting panty clad baddies i'm a bachelor
i'm high and polite cause po-lice is in back of us
and write with the same hand i smack 'em up with
stretching out the fifteen i had initially
icky thump sticky kush lit up in a rental jeep

chop the tops off the coupes
the cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
the spider joint
and you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes right
watch the body drop

verse
drug dealin' aside ghostwritin' aside
let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
even though you're multi i see that your soul don't look alive
the m's count different when baby divides the pie wait
let's examine why
your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
i'll start it at the home front   i'm on one
dennis graham stay off the 'gram bitch i'm on one
you mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
your father walked away at five   hell of a dad thing
marriage is somethin' that sandi never had drake
how you a winner but she keep comin' in last place
monkey-suit dennis you parade him
a steve harvey-suit nigga made him
confused always felt you weren't black enough
afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
since you name-dropped my fianc  e
let 'em know who you chose as your beyonc  
sophie knows better as your baby mother
cleaned her up for ig but the stench is on her
a baby's involved it's deeper than rap
we talkin' character let me keep with the facts
you are hiding a child let that boy come home
deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol ooh
adonis is your son
and he deserves more than an adidas press run that's real
love that baby respect that girl
forget she's a pornstar let her be your world yuugh
how dare you put ye in my verses
i'm selfish i want all of the curses
i'm pre-bookin' the churches me versus three hearses
if we all go to hell it'll be worth it
already aligned with the greats and on that same note
the only ones i chase are two ghosts
still givin' you classics that's the only thing that dates me
ovo  hunched over like he    tick tick tick
how much time he got that man is sick sick sick
i got the devil flow nigga   six-six-six
surgical summer with it   snip snip snip
and you don't really want it with him

outro
surgical summer volume 
we gon' take this slow
we just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer

verse  pusha t
twenty-plus years of selling johnson & johnson
i started out as a baby-faced monster
no wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
my teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
gem star razor and a dinner plate
arm & hammer and a mason jar that's my dinner date
then crack the window in the kitchen let it ventilate
'cause i let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
nigga i was crack in the school zone
two beepers on me starter jacket that was two-toned
four lockers four different bitches got their mule on
black ferris bueller cutting school with his jewels on
couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
what i sell for pain in the hood i'm a doctor
zhivago tried to fight the urge like ivan drago if he dies he dies
like doughboy to tre if he rides he rides
throwing punches in his room if he cries he cries
we don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
we add a link to the chain inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
we playin' on a higher game of chess
once you delegate his bills who gon' fuck his bitch the best
a million megapixels of the pyrex
started on the scale digital my only timex
nigga this is timeless simply 'cause it's honest
pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
nigga this is simon says simon red
blood on your diamonds 'til you dying     dead yuugh

instrumentals from my momma's christmas party

i still smell crime my little brother crying
smokers repeatedly buying my sega genesis either that
or my auntie was stealing it hit the pipe and start feeling it
ooh wee cut me some slack weed never did that
this was different geez louise please help me relax
quantum physics could never show you the world i was in
when i was ten back when nine ounces had got you ten
and nine times out of ten niggas don't pay attention
and when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
my daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
took a l started selling soap fiends bubble bath
broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
shirt buttoned open taco meat laying on his gold
i said daddy one day i'mma get you right with  zips
 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
drop some ice cubes in it deebo on perimeter
he said son how come you think you be my connect
i said pops your ass is washed up with all due respect
he said well nigga then show me how it all makes sense

when i envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips

soaked getting jiggy with it in bel-air's richest

never imagined being stuck with you
years later we in the villa suites
top back we on vanilla seats
reminiscing about my episodes
with them extra hoes but you didn't cheat
cold nights when you couldn't sleep
celine bags were the given treat
c-class helped you see past
all them other hoes and that they niggas weak
whoo i'm good money
got you talking in dollar signs
it's all good that she the top bitch
but she just wanna know the bottom line
i don't blame her i don't change her
i just sit back and give her options

outro kevin gates
please don't mind
i just need some time
these requirements
just gotta make sure you meet all mine
standing there staring with your bow-legged stance
trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
hustle in the hood strong with the bands
look at you as something more than a ho i could smash
or being something bad i could bone at the bag
pole in my pants standing at attention
when you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
glance at the ceiling
now your glass is empty
thinking backwards really
i done grabbed a vixen
that supposed to be a fitter after video
stacks'll really blow
dancers get exposed
missing you when you not around
we text each other when out of town
you remain the same no matter up or down
these other women stay pretending
money come and they help us spend it
but'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
i was down and out and had to go to prison
kinda high role play acki
and again i say i like these hoes

valentino summers and wave runners
chains on my niggas like slave runners
drug dealers anonymous
how many madonnas can that mazda fit
my brick talk is more than obvious it   s ominous
garages the phantom ghouls ghosts and goblins
blonde mohawk the collection i   m dennis rodman
the money count is the only moment of silence
cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
hat trick under my mattress
date i stop still has an asterisk after it
after all i can make a call
i can baptize a brick
as i wash away my sins like a catholic
who the fuck ain't mastered this
america   s nightmare's in flint
children of a lesser god when your melanin   s got a tint
and i can   t even mention what i sent or what i spent
cause my name in  wheelers is evidence
i put my boos in those cruise collections
life   s a bitch
a to z on her shoe collection take your pick
paid in full like     gs on my body
the new gucci has less monograms god   s got him
let he without sin cast the first stone
so i built that all glass quad level first home
shatter all of your misconceptions
hold all of them missing weapons
you thought i would miss my blessing
the ultimate misdirection ya

spit slick attack is subliminal
flowers on my mind but the rhyme style sinister
stand behind my own bars like a seasoned criminal
gotham city streets i'll play the *bleep*
crushing any system that belittles us
antidote to every poison they administer
switch it like time signatures
colors in my aura tend cover the perimeter
brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through

and people left alone
pick up the phone
don't leave me alone in this cruel cruel world

verse 
as a kid all i wanted was to kill a man
be like my daddy's friends hopping out that minivan
chrome 's spinning like a ceiling fan
crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
talking to me monotone hardly ever coming home
knew he was the villain never been a fan of superman
beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming
bitch you better listen when i speak my mind
used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
but made sure a nigga plate was full and i shined
was walking in the first day of school new j's and all of that
football was cornerback never made a game i played for compton high
but my daddy was the man that would be suicide
picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
always told me that he loved me fuck his foolish pride
as a kid all i wanted was to kill a man

hook
cause my daddy did it eyes bloodshot
with the caddy tinted fuck handouts
fuck the county building never seen that
catch him riding round the city with the seat back
with the seat back with the seat back
catch him ride round the city with the seat back
with the seat back with the seat back
catch him ride round the city with the seat back

verse 
as a kid all i wanted was a hundred grand
uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
and it never did said it'd make me be a better man
smoking in the crib hiding dip inside of soda cans
black bandana on his arm needle in his hand
momma trying to wake him up young so i ain't understand
why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep used to see him stand
out in the alley through my window
drinking hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
lights flashing now he running from the winslows
hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
sometimes she wouldn't open it sitting on the couch
face emotionless i don't think they ever noticed that i noticed it
as a kid all i wanted a hundred grand

when the cops pull up the talking stops
you know shit is hot niggas getting caught
drugs in abundance the canines bark
but you can't arrest everyone in the park
move with some wisdom the youngin' smart
that's why i could survive out here after dark
i don't fuck with you you niggas marks
word around town you work with narcs
when the pound hit i just make it spark
hoping that my sound get me onto the charts

wish i was jigga man carefree livin'

i'm that cleveland nigga rolling with them brooklyn boys
you know how it be when you start living large
i control my own life charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram
or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted how'd you do it mom huh

an independent older sister kept me fly when she could

verse 
i'm super paranoid like a th sense
since my father died i ain't been right since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split an eighth of shrooms just so i could see the universe
i tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room and soon i'm consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
it's all said and done and my cocks been sucked
so now i'm in the cut alcohol in the wound
my heart's an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cancun
where it is never sunny the dark side of the moon
so it's more than right i try to shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand... fam

verse 
i was close to go and trying some coke
and a happy ending would be slitting my throat
ignorance to cope man ignorance is bliss
ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then i'd probably be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then i'd probably be a jackass
don't give a shit what people talkin' bout fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 
wanna settle down stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty
i just need a thoroughbred cook when i'm hungry
ass all chunky brain is insanity
only things that calm me down pussy and some cali trees
and i get both never truly satisfied
i am happy that's just the saddest lie

beyond from the heart from the soul you can feel
